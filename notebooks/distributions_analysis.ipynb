For a given skill, let $n$ be the number of groups and let $x_i$ denote the frequency of that skill in group $i$. We first sort these values in non‐decreasing order and denote them by $x_{(1)}$, $x_{(2)}$, $...$, $x_{(n)}$. (in our case $n=3$) The Gini index \\(G\\) is then computed as:\n",

    "   - If all $x_i$ are identical, each $\\lvert x_i - x_j\\rvert = 0$, so $G=0$ (perfect equality).  \n",
    "   - If one group has **all** of the mass and the others have zero, then the numerator is maximized, driving $G$ toward 1 (maximal inequality).  \n",

    "2. **Normalization**:  \n",
    "   - Dividing by $n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ ensures $G$ ranges between 0 and (just under) 1 regardless of absolute scale or number of groups.  \n",

    "   - A **low Gini** (near 0) indicates the attribute is nearly equally represented across all groups.  \n",
    "   - A **high Gini** signals that the attribute is concentrated in one or a few groups, revealing a strong disparity.\n",
