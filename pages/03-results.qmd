In this section we walk through our key findings:

## 1. Exploratory Findings  
As previously explained on the Pipeline page, our study first tried to highlight the errors the parser makes in categories such as Language, Driving License, and Job Title.


| Skill                   |    TP   |    FP   |    TN  |   FN
|-------------------------|--------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|
| Language skills         |    70%  |    55%  |   50%  |   50%  |
| Driving license skills  |    80%  |    78%  |   75%  |   75%  |
| Driving license skills  |    80%  |    78%  |   75%  |   75%  |

## 2. Key Bias Metrics 

Due to the presence of numerous errors from the parser, we focused our analysis on the previously discussed demographic groups. To do so, we employed several metrics that specifically account for false negatives, since these result from exact matches and therefore offer high reliability. 

These metrics include:

- **Equality of Opportunity** : the probability to be correctly classified as positive (recall):
$$
\frac{TP}{TP + FN}
$$
- **Calibration Negative Predictive Value**: the proportion of correct predictions should be equal within each group:
$$
\frac{TN}{TN + FN}
$$
- **Conditional Use Error for Negative Class**: the share of negative predictions that turn out to be wrong:
$$
\frac{FN}{TN + FN}
$$

## 3. Summary of Findings  
- Systematic over-extraction of hard skills in all languages.  
- Soft skills under-detected especially in Italian and French CVs.  
- Gender skew: certain leadership-type skills more often missed in female profiles.
