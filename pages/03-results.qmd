### 3.2 Key Bias Metrics  
- **Metric:** Difference in detection rate of “leadership” skill by inferred gender  
  - Male CVs: 45%  
  - Female CVs: 30%  
- **Metric:** Under-detection of soft skills in non-English CVs  
  - English: 70%  
  - Italian: 55%  
  - French: 50%

| Skill        | English | Italian | French |
|--------------|--------:|--------:|-------:|
| Soft skills  |     70% |     55% |    50% |
| Hard skills  |     80% |     78% |    75% |

## 4. Summary of Findings  
- Systematic over-extraction of hard skills in all languages.  
- Soft skills under-detected especially in Italian and French CVs.  
- Gender skew: certain leadership-type skills more often missed in female profiles.
