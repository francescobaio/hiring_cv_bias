Below is the high level workflow we followed. Feel free to click each step to dive into the detailed notebook.

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   We standardized and filtered the raw, anonymized CV text (removed stopwords, fixed encoding issues, normalized formatting).

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   We explored basic statistics: total resumes per language, average length, and initial skill counts to understand data shape.  
   🔗 [See the Exploration notebook](../notebooks/data_exploration.html)

3. **Distributions Analysis**  
   We plotted hard vs. soft skill frequencies, language‐based differences, and other distributions to spot obvious skews.  
   🔗 [See the Distributions Analysis notebook](../notebooks/distributions_analysis.html)

4. **Bias Detection**  
   We applied group‐based comparisons (e.g. by inferred gender or language) to uncover where the parser over- or under-extracts certain skills.
