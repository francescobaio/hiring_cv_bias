Here we outline the work steps we followed to answer the questions in our problem statement. In the first subsection, we cover two initial setup tasks that prepare the data for the rest of the pipeline:

1. Translating CVs **from Italian into English** so we can apply semantic-matching techniques consistently. 
2. Labeling with an LLM each extracted skill as either a **hard skill or a soft skill**. 🔗 [See the Hard Soft skills labelling notebook](../hiring_cv_bias/hard_soft_skills_labelling/hard_soft_skill_labelling.html)   

With these preparations in place, our pipeline we built is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   We standardized and filtered the raw, anonymized CV texts with structural issues as:
   - Empty / Whitespace-Only/ Very Short Text
   - High Repetition / Low Structure
   - Low token & vocabulary Richness
   - Corrupted CVs with a fraction of “unusual” characters
   - CVs with Placeholder Tails (e.g. “XXXXXXXXXX…”)
   - CVs with Poor Translations

   Parsed skills of the candidates with corrupted CVs has been also excluded.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   Once the data had been cleaned, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the skills extracted by the parser, focusing on:
   - **Distribution of parsed skills and job information** : explore how different skills are distributed across roles and sectors.
   - **Skills-per-candidate distribution**: analyze the number of skills each candidate has, flagging any outliers.
   - **Hard vs. soft skills**: examine and compare the distributions of hard skills versus soft skills.

3. **Distributions Analysis**  

   This analysis aims to uncover distributional imbalances by merging demographic data (age, gender, location) from the Candidates sheet of the reverse-matching dataset with parsed skill data extracted from raw CVs:

   - **Gender distribution**: assess representation across different gender identities
   - **Location distribution**: map geographic concentrations of applicants
   - **Age distribution**: identify age-related skews and outliers
   - **Hard vs. soft skills**: compare the prevalence of technical skills versus interpersonal competencies

   >**Why This Matters**: <br>
   >Identifying these imbalances is critical for building a robust, fair CV-parsing pipeline. By detecting and mitigating biases in both the raw CV inputs and their parsed outputs, we can ensure more equitable candidate evaluation across all demographic groups.

4. **Bias Detection**  
   We applied group‐based comparisons (e.g. by inferred gender or language) to uncover where the parser over- or under-extracts certain skills.
