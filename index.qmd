This site delivers a focused examination of the biases that a proprietary CV parser may introduce when extracting skills from a corpus of anonymized, raw resumes.

By parsing hundreds of CVs, we assessed how hard and soft competencies are identified across different languages and candidate profiles, uncovering systematic under- or over-representation of certain skills. Our findings pinpoint specific extraction disparities, offering clear direction for improving the parser’s fairness and accuracy.


- **[01 – Problem Statement](pages/01-problem.qmd)**  
    Defines the scope, data sources and key fairness questions guiding our bias analysis of the CV parser.

- **[02 – Pipeline](pages/02-pipeline.qmd)**  
    Walks through each stage of the parser: from ingesting anonymized resumes to extracting and classifying hard and soft skills.

- **[03 – Results](pages/03-results.qmd)**  
    Presents visualizations and statistics that expose where and how the parser over or under represents certain competencies.

- **04 – Future work**  
  Additional validation steps and bias mitigation strategies for the parsing engine.
